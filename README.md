## Decentralized, Asynchronous P2P Chat

**Sept** is a video and chat application similar to Discord but operates without a central server. Clients connect directly to each other, resulting in faster connections than similar applications. Other limitations, such as file upload limits, do not exist.

Inspired by various projects and technologies, such as [VXLAN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7348) and the old [Skype P2P](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0412017) infrastructure.

## Features
- **Private & Encrypted**: All messages are sent over an encrypted channel and stored locally on your device. Sept cannot see your messages.
- **No Upload Limits**: Share terabytes of files for free‚Äîno need to upload them.
- **Fast**: Faster than other chat and communication programs due to its P2P nature.
- **Better Video Quality**: Streams are sent directly to your peers without server throttling.

## Build
First, deploy a [Sept Login Server](https://github.com/piheta/sept-login-server):
```bash
