## decentralized, asynchronous p2p chat

sept is a video/chat application similar to discord with no central server. The clients connect directly to eachother making the connection faster than similar applications. Other limitations such as file upload limit are also non existent. 
sept is inspired by various projects, such as hamachi and the old skype p2p infrastructure.
